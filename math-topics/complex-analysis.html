        <h2>Complex Numbers</h2>
        <p>Clasically, mathematicians have wanted functions (in the sense of the so-called "function theory") to be freely differentiable and integrable. As real analysis has shown, not all differentiable functions satisfy these requirements. The subset of those that do presents its own irregularities, such as smooth functions that are not given locally by their Taylor series. Extending the purview of calculus to the complex plane addresses these and other issues that crop up as a result of pathologies with the real numbers.</p>
        <p>A nagging issue with the real numbers is that they're not algebraically closed. This means that there are polynomial equations with no solutions. Chief among them perhaps is the equation \[x^2 = -1.\] In fact, the lack of square roots for real numbers is seemingly the source of the lack of even \(n\)th roots for the numbers which don't have them (namely, the negatives). This can be seen by letting \(n\) be even, and observing that we may write \(n = 2^{n_0}k\) where \(k\) is odd. Then the equation \(x^n = a\) becomes \(x^{2^{n_0}} = \sqrt[k]{a}\), where the left-hand-side consists of repeately taking square roots.</p>
        <p>Naturally, to address this we should like a field where negative numbers have square roots. The astute reader will already have noticed that to accomplish this a sacrifice must be made: the field cannot be ordered, since in an ordered field every element satisfies the equation \(x^2 \geq 0\). Nonetheless, our development of such a field in the form of the complex numbers will allow us to recover many results from calculus on real numbers by way of treating components where order is necessary via absolute values, which do exist for complex numbers. Note that we can provide solutions to any equation of the form \(x^2 = -a\) for \(a > 0\) provided we have a solution to \(x^2 = -1\), since it should stand to reason that \(\sqrt{{-a}} = \sqrt{{-1}} \cdot \sqrt{a}\) (note that the complex square root will in general not be multiplicative, but this particular case does work out). We thus proceed to develop the theory of a field of numbers \(\mathbb{C} \supseteq \mathbb{R}\) with an element \(i = \sqrt{-1}\).</p>
        <p>The field \(\mathbb{C}\) of complex numbers can be constructed in many ways, but we will focus on one which this author feels most accurately reflects the algebraic flavour of \(\mathbb{C}\) as the algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{R}\). Consider the set \(\mathbb{R}[x]\) of polynomials with real coefficients in the variable \(x\). Note that any element of \(\mathbb{R}[x]\) can be expressed as products of linear and irreducible quadratic polynomials. To see this, note that if \(p(0) = 0\), then \(p\) must have zero constant term, so it can be written as \(xp_1(x)\) for some polynomial \(p_1(x)\) of degree \(\deg{p} - 1\). Similarly, if \(p(a) = 0\), we may write \(p\) as a polynomial \(g(x + a)\) so that \(g(0) = p(a) = 0\) and there exists \(g_1\) with \(g(x + a) = xg_1(x + a)\) with \(\deg{g_1} = \deg{g} - 1\). As such we may write \(p(x) = (x - a)g_1(x)\). By the well-ordering principle there's an expression \(p(x) = p_0(x) p_2(x)\), where \(p_0(x)\) is a product of linear polynomials and \(p_2(x)\) is nowhere vanishing (and is hence of even degree). Note that \(p_2\) is not divisible by any odd-degree polynomials because those vanish as stated before. Thus, it is a product of irreducible even-degree polynomials. We claim that any polynomial of even degree greater than \(2\) must be reducible. To see this, assume towards a contradiction that this is not the case, and let \(f\) be an even-degree irreducible polynomial with degree greater than \(2\). By the Euclidean division algorithm, there exist \(q,r\) with \(\deg{r} < 2\) such that \(f = x^2q + r\). If \(r = 0\), we already have a contradiction since this means \(f\) is reducible, so assume \(r \neq 0\). Then \(r\) is at most degree \(1\). Assume \(r\) has degree \(0\) without loss of generality, since we can repeat the same argument we're about to make dividing by \(x^3\) instead of \(x^2\) in the case where its degree is \(1\). If \(\deg{r} = 0\), then \(x^2q\) has the same degree as \(f\), and since \(f\) vanishes nowhere it has nonzero constant, so we may divide by \(x^2 - a\) instead for some \(a\) such that \(f = (x^2 - a)q_0\). We leave the reader to fill in the details.</p>
        <p>Note that by the previous paragraph, the maximal ideals of \(\mathbb{R}[x]\) are generated by polynomials of the form \(x - a\) or \(x^2 - a\) which are irreducible (if the quadratic is not irreducible it does not generate a maximal ideal because maximal ideals must in particular be prime). Since \(x^2 + 1\) has no solution over \(\mathbb{R}\), the ideal \((x^2 + 1)\) is thus maximal and \(\mathbb{C} := \mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1)\) is a field. Abusing notation so that equality is up to equivalence, note that if we let \(i = \overline{x}\) then \(i^2 = -1\) as desired. Note also that every element of \(\mathbb{C}\) may be written as \(x + iy\) for \(x,y \in \mathbb{R}\) so that \(\mathbb{C}\) is a two-dimensional vector space over \(\mathbb{R}\) and we can think of it geometrically as \(\mathbb{R}^2\), under the identifications \(1 \mapsto (1,0)\) and \(i \mapsto (0,1)\). In fact, with these identifications we obtain a rich dictionary between plane geometry and analysis. For instance, note that using the familiar power series \[\begin{aligned} e^x &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!},\\ \sin(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!},\\ \cos(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} \end{aligned}\] which the reader may verify converge absolutely and uniformly everywhere in \(\mathbb{C}\) under the usual topology from its identification with \(\mathbb{R}^2\), to obtain the equality \[e^{iy} = \cos(y) + i\sin(y),\] from which we can derive, using the fact that extending multiplication to the geometric identification with \(\mathbb{R}^2\) gives \((a,b) \cdot (c,d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc)\), that \[\left(\cos(x + y), \sin(x + y)\right) = \left(\cos(x)\cos(y) - \sin(x)\sin(y), \cos(x)\sin(y) + \sin(x)\cos(y)\right),\] which are familiar trigonometric identities.</p>
